RS-JSON

Yet another JSON decoder/encoder.

If you can't wait until YASON is fixed, then this library is for you.
The main differences are listed below.

   * The parser is strictly RFC 8259 compliant where it makes sense.
     However, you can tweak the behavior of the parser to suite your
     needs.

   * The serializer only supports a compact pretty printing format.

   * JSON objects can be represented as hash-tables, associated lists,
     or property lists.  The default is to use alists.

   * JSON arrays can be represented as vectors or lists.  The default
     is to use vectors.

   * The JSON values ‘true’, ‘false’, and ‘null’ are represented by
     the keywords ‘:true’, ‘:false’, and ‘:null’ respectively.  But
     you can change that to suite your needs.

   * The default configuration is round-trip save, i.e. you can read
     a JSON value and write it back without loss of information.  This
     is a strict requirement when updating a web resource via an HTTP
     GET/PUT cycle.

   * Performance is competitive to other “fast” JSON libraries out
     there.

                                                                     [Condition]
encoding-error
   Condition type for an encoding error.

   Class precedence list:

        ‘encoding-error’, ‘json-error’, ...

                                                                     [Condition]
json-error
   Base class for all JSON errors.

   Class precedence list:

        ‘json-error’, ‘stream-error’, ‘error’, ...

                                                                     [Condition]

                                                              [Special Variable]
*allow-duplicate-object-keys*
   Whether or not to accept duplicate keys in JSON objects.
   If true, the value of an existing object member is replaced by a
   successive object member with the same key.  Special value ‘:ignore’
   means to ignore successive duplicate object members, i.e. the value
   of an existing object member will not be replaced.  Special value
   ‘:append’ means to add a duplicate object member to the Lisp data
   structure – this feature is only available for alists and plists.
   If false, signal a ‘syntax-error’.  This is the default.

   ECMA-404 says nothing about duplicate object keys.  RFC 8259 says
   that object keys should be unique.  Anyway, with this user option,
   you have the choice.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*allow-lax-numbers*
   Whether or not to accept non-standard syntax of numbers.
   If true, numbers may have an explicit plus sign and digits before or
   after the decimal point may be omitted.  Default is false.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*allow-literal-object-keys*
   Whether or not to accept literal names as keys of object members.
   Default is false.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*allow-trailing-comma*
   Whether or not to accept a comma after the last object member
   or after the last array element.  Default is false.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*allow-unicode-graphic*
   Whether or not to escape Unicode graphic characters in JSON strings.
   If true, any Unicode graphic character is printed as is.  Otherwise,
   a graphic character is escaped like any other non-graphic character.
   Thus, the JSON output is plain US-ASCII.  Default is true.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*allow-unicode-whitespace*
   Whether or not to accept any Unicode whitespace character.
   If true, any character with the Unicode whitespace property is
   considered a whitespace character.  Otherwise, only the space,
   horizontal tab, line feed, and carriage return character are
   considered a whitespace character.  Default is false.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*array-as*
   The Lisp data structure used to represent a JSON array.
   Value is either ‘:vector’ or ‘:list’.  The default is to use
   vectors.

   If you want to use lists, you should set the ‘*list-encoder*’
   special variable to the ‘encode-array’ function.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*decode-array-hook*
   Hook to run after a JSON array has been decoded.
   Value has to be a function designator.  The function is called with
   one argument, the Lisp data structure representing the JSON array;
   see the ‘*array-as*’ special variable.  The return value of the
   function is used as the actual array value.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*decode-object-hook*
   Hook to run after a JSON object has been decoded.
   Value has to be a function designator.  The function is called with
   one argument, the Lisp data structure representing the JSON object;
   see the ‘*object-as*’ special variable.  The return value of the
   function is used as the actual object value.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*encode-symbol-hook*
   Hook to convert a symbol into a string.
   Value has to be a function designator.  The function is called with
   the symbol as the only argument.  The return value of the function
   must be a string.

   Special value ‘:upcase’, ‘:downcase’, ‘:capitalize’, ‘:preserve’, or
   ‘:invert’ means to change the case of the symbol name respectively.
   See the ‘*print-case*’ special variable and ‘readtable-case’ function.
   A value of ‘nil’ means to use the value of the ‘*print-case*’ special
   variable.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*false*
   The symbol to represent the JSON value ‘false’.
   Default is ‘:false’, but ‘nil’ may be appropriate, too.  For the
   later, please take care of ambiguities since ‘nil’ also represents
   the empty list.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*list-encoder*
   The actual function used to encode a list.

   Suitable values are ‘encode-object’ or ‘encode-array’ to encode
   a list as a JSON object or as a JSON array respectively.  Default
   is ‘encode-object’ in accordance with the default value of the
   ‘*object-as*’ special variable.

   The function is called with one argument, the list.  The return
   value of the function is ignored.

   See also the ‘*nil-encoder*’ special variable.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*maximum-nesting-depth*
   The maximum number of nested JSON structures.
   Value must be a positive number and should be at least 20.  A value
   of ‘nil’ means to not limit the depth of nesting.  The default value
   is 1000.  This option only has an effect when reading JSON values.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*nil-encoder*
   The actual function used to encode ‘nil’.

   Suitable values are ‘encode-list’, ‘encode-false’, or ‘encode-null’
   to encode ‘nil’ as a list, as the JSON ‘false’ value, or as the JSON
   ‘null’ value respectively.  Default is ‘encode-list’ in accordance
   with the default value of the ‘*object-as*’ special variable.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*null*
   The symbol to represent the JSON value ‘null’.
   Default is ‘:null’, but ‘nil’ may be appropriate, too.  For the
   later, please take care of ambiguities since ‘nil’ also represents
   falsity and the empty list.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*object-as*
   The Lisp data structure used to represent a JSON object.
   Value is either ‘:hash-table’, ‘:alist’, or ‘:plist’.  The default
   is to use alists.

   Object keys are compared with ‘equal’, i.e. using strings as object
   keys works as expected.  This also holds when representing objects
   as plists.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*object-key-decoder*
   The function to convert the key string of an object member.
   Default is the ‘identity’ function.

   The function is called with one argument, the key string.  The value
   of the function is used as the key for the data structure produced.
   See also the ‘*object-as*’ special variable.

   If you want to use symbols as objects keys, the simplest solution is
   to intern them into the current package.

        (let ((*object-key-decoder* #'intern)
              (*encode-symbol-hook* :preserve))
          (parse "{\"foo\" : 42}"))

         ⇒ ((|foo| . 42))

   Using symbols safes some memory if you have many objects with the
   same keys.  It may also speed up object member access.  But please
   remember: don't speculate, profile!

                                                              [Special Variable]
*true*
   The symbol to represent the JSON value ‘true’.
   Default is ‘:true’, but ‘t’ may be appropriate, too.

                                                                      [Function]
array-element (value)
   Encode a JSON array element.
   See the ‘with-array’ macro.

                                                              [Generic Function]
encode (data)
   Encode Lisp data as a JSON value.

   Argument DATA is the Lisp data to be serialized.

   The JSON output is written to the ‘*standard-output*’ stream.
   The return value of an ‘encode’ method is ignored.

   The ‘with-object’ and ‘with-array’ macros can be used to define JSON
   encoders for your own Lisp data structures.  For example, define an
   encoder for a CLOS class:

        (defclass bank-account ()
          ((iban
            :initarg :iban
            :initform (error "Missing IBAN argument."))
           (balance
            :initarg :balance
            :initform 0)))

        (defmethod encode ((object bank-account))
          "Encode a bank account as a JSON object."
          (with-object
            (object-member "iban" (slot-value object 'iban))
            (object-member "balance" (slot-value object 'balance))))

   After that,

        (serialize t (make-instance 'bank-account :iban "DE75512108001245126199"))

   prints

        {"iban" : "DE75512108001245126199", "balance" : 0}

                                                                        [Method]
encode ((data list))
   Encode a list by calling ‘*list-encoder*’.

                                                                        [Method]

encode ((data rational))
   Encode a rational number as a JSON number.
   Affected by ‘*read-default-float-format*’.

                                                                        [Method]

   Encode an integer as a JSON number.

                                                                        [Method]

   Encode a character as a JSON string.

                                                                        [Method]
encode ((data symbol))
   Encode a symbol as a JSON string.
   Affected by ‘*true*’, ‘*false*’, ‘*null*’, ‘*encode-symbol-hook*’,
   and ‘*print-case*’.

   Exceptional situations:

      * Signals a ‘program-error’ if the value returned by the
        ‘*encode-symbol-hook*’ function is not a string.

                                                                        [Method]

encode ((data (eql nil)))
   Encode ‘nil’ by calling ‘*nil-encoder*’.

                                                                        [Method]
encode ((data (eql t)))
   Encode ‘t’ as a JSON ‘true’ value.

                                                                        [Method]
encode ((data (eql :null)))
   Encode ‘:null’ as a JSON ‘null’ value.

                                                                        [Method]

encode (data)
   The default encoding method.
   Signals an ‘encoding-error’.

                                                                      [Function]
encode-array (data)
   Encode Lisp data as a JSON array.

   Argument DATA is the Lisp data to be serialized as a JSON array.
    Value has to be a sequence, i.e. a vector or a list.

   Mostly useful for binding ‘*list-encoder*’.

                                                                      [Function]
encode-false (data)
   Constantly print a JSON ‘false’ value.

   Mostly useful for binding ‘*nil-encoder*’.

                                                                      [Function]
encode-list (data)
   Encode a list by calling ‘*list-encoder*’.

   Mostly useful for binding ‘*nil-encoder*’.

                                                                      [Function]
encode-null (data)
   Constantly print a JSON ‘null’ value.

   Mostly useful for binding ‘*nil-encoder*’.

                                                                      [Function]
encode-object (data)
   Encode Lisp data as a JSON object.

   Argument DATA is the Lisp data to be serialized as a JSON object.
    Value has to be a hash table, an associated list, or a property list.
   If DATA is a list, the value of the ‘*object-as*’ special variable
    affects the interpretation of DATA.

   Mostly useful for binding the ‘*list-encoder*’ special variable.

                                                                      [Function]
object-member (key value)
   Encode a JSON object member.
   See the ‘with-object’ macro.

                                                                      [Function]
parse (source &key junk-allowed)
   Read a JSON value.

   First argument SOURCE is the input object.  Value is either a
    stream, a string, or a pathname.  The special value ‘t’ is
    equal to ‘*standard-input*’
   If keyword argument JUNK-ALLOWED is true, do not signal an error
    of type ‘syntax-error’ if a non-whitespace character occurs after
    the JSON value.  Default value is false.

   The ‘parse’ function expects exactly one JSON value.  Any value
   is accepted, not only an object or array.  Optional leading and
   trailing whitespace is ignored.

   Return value is the Lisp representation of the JSON value.
   Secondary value is the position where the parsing ends, or
   ‘nil’ if the position can not be determined.

   Exceptional situations:

      * Signals an ‘end-of-file’ error if the input ends in the
        middle of a JSON value.

      * Signals a ‘syntax-error’ if the input contains an invalid
        JSON structure.

      * May signal an ‘arithmetic-error’ if a JSON number can not
        be represented as a Lisp number.

      * Signals a ‘program-error’ if JSON objects are parsed as
        hash tables, ‘*allow-duplicate-object-keys*’ is bound to
        ‘:append’, and a duplicate object member occurs.

                                                                      [Function]
serialize (destination data &key pretty)
   Print a Lisp data structure as a JSON value.

   First argument DESTINATION is the output object.  Value is either a
    stream, a string, or a pathname.  The special value ‘t’ is equal to
    ‘*standard-output*’ and ‘nil’ means to return a string.
   Second argument DATA is the Lisp data structure to be serialized.
   If keyword argument PRETTY is true, pretty print the JSON value in
    a compact format.  Default is false.

   The actual serialization of Lisp data as a JSON value is performed
   by the ‘encode’ methods (which see).

   If DESTINATION is a stream, a string, a pathname, or ‘t’, then the
   result is ‘nil’.  Otherwise, the result is a string containing the
   output.

   Exceptional situations:

      * Signals an ‘encoding-error’ if the Lisp data can not be
        encoded as a JSON value.

      * May signal an ‘arithmetic-error’ if a rational number is
        converted to a floating-point number.

   Notes:

   If the pretty printer is disabled, JSON output is just a flat
   sequence of characters.  For example:

        [{"foo" : 42, "bar" : ["baz", "hack"]}, null]

   There is no explicit or implicit line break since all control
   characters are escaped.  While this is fast and machine readable,
   it's difficult for humans to reveal the structure of the data.

   If the pretty printer is enabled, JSON output is more visually
   appearing.  Here is the same example as above but pretty printed:

        [{"foo" : 42,
          "bar" : ["baz",
                   "hack"]},
         null]

   Explicit line breaks occur after object members and array elements
   and the items of these compound structures are lined up nicely.

                                                                      [Constant]
serializer
   Format control for printing a Lisp data structure as a JSON value.
   The value of the ‘*print-pretty*’ special variable determines if the
   JSON output is pretty printed.  For example,

        (format t "JSON: ~@?~%" serializer #((("foo" . 42) ("bar" . #("baz" "hack"))) :null))

   may print

        JSON: [{"foo" : 42,
                "bar" : ["baz",
                         "hack"]},
               null]

   The value of this constant is a format control function that follows
   the conventions for a function created by the ‘formatter’ macro.  See
   also the ‘serializer’ function for another method for how to print
   JSON values with the ‘format’ function.

                                                                      [Function]
serializer (stream data &optional colonp at-sign-p &rest parameters)
   Format function for printing a Lisp data structure as a JSON value.

   First argument STREAM is the output stream.
   Second argument DATA is the Lisp data structure to be serialized.
   If optional third argument COLONP is true, output the JSON value in
    a pretty printed format.  Default is false.
   The remaining arguments are ignored.

   This function is designed so that it can be called by a slash format
   directive, i.e. ‘~/serializer/’.  If the colon modifier is given, use
   the pretty printer.  For example,

        (format t "JSON: ~/serializer/~%" #((("foo" . 42) ("bar" . #("baz" "hack"))) :null))

   prints

        JSON: [{"foo" : 42, "bar" : ["baz", "hack"]}, null]

   whereas

        (format t "JSON: ~:/serializer/~%" #((("foo" . 42) ("bar" . #("baz" "hack"))) :null))

   prints

        JSON: [{"foo" : 42,
                "bar" : ["baz",
                         "hack"]},
               null]

   how to print JSON values with the ‘format’ function.

with-array (&body body)
   Encode a JSON array.

   The BODY calls ‘(array-element VALUE)’ to encode an array element.

                                                                         [Macro]
with-default-values ((&rest ignored) &body body)
   Establish a lexical environment with all special variables bound
   to their default values.

                                                                         [Macro]
with-object (&body body)
   Encode a JSON object.

   The BODY calls ‘(object-member KEY VALUE)’ to encode the key/value
   pair of an object member.
